# Concurrency and Paralelism

This course involved two projects, made in groups of two students. The first one about paralelism and the second one about concurrency. I no longer have the code for these projects, but the most important part were the reports, which are showcased here.

## Project 1 (Paralelism)
- Design and implement a parallel version of the Othello game using Cilk+.
- Evaluate the design decisions/implementations and their impact of the program's performance.
- Made in C and Cilk+.

## Project 2 (Concurrency)
- Make use of different techniques to properly synchronize the concurrent access to a given data structure.
- Evaluate, benchmark and discuss results under different settings of workload.
- Made in Java.
