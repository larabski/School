# Human-Computer Interaction

This was a semester-long project made in groups of 3 students. The whole process started out with a brainstorming session for ideas, went past a paper-only testing phase and ended up in a fairly functional computational prototype.

Because this was just a prototype (and was built under *very* tight time constraints), the code wasn't of great quality and thus is not worth showing here. However, we were quite satisfied with the final result, and it granted us with a nice grade.
We wanted it to be a cross-platform desktop app, and so it was built with Electron and React.

## Project Description & Screenshots

Our focus is to increase students' productivity, by making their time management easier. They'll be able to plan study schedules and routines, create tasks and manage calendars. They won't ever be caught off-guard with deadlines, and with regular feedback on their performance, they won't fall behind schedule throughout the semester.
