# Machine Learning

This course involved two projects, made in groups of two students. Both projects were made in Python with the aid of its ML-related libraries (```sklearn```, ```matplotlib```, ```pandas```, ...). Once again, the reports are the most relevant part.

## Project 1
For this project we were given a data set from the UCI machine learning repository, which we proceeded to fit and test with three distinct classifiers: ```Logistic Regression```, ```k-Nearest Neighbors``` and ```Naïve Bayes```. This involved (but was not restricted to) parameter optimization, model fitting and validation. To finalize, we estimated each classifier's true error, and compared the classifiers using McNemar's test with a 95% confidence interval.

## Project 2
We were given a data set with all the seismic events of magnitude at least 6.5 in the last 100 years, obtained from the USGS catalog, with the goal of examining the performance of three different clustering algorithms (```K-means```, ```Gaussian Mixture Models``` and ```DBSCAN```) in this problem of clustering seismic events.

To do so, we varied these algorithms' main parameter values and analyzed the corresponding behaviors, in the context of our problem (with the help of various evaluation indexes, both internal and external). For the particular case of DBSCAN, this involved some research on the original paper of the algorithm. To finish off, we picked the algorithm that we considered to be the most effective in this context and documented the entirety of our approach.
